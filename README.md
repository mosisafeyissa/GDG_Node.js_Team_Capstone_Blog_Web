## Setting Up

### `.env` File
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project to store environment variables. For this project, you'll need to define a `PORT` number for the server to listen on.

Example `.env` file:
```env
PORT=3000
```

## Key Concepts

### Prettier
Prettier is a code formatting tool that ensures your code is consistently styled. It automatically formats your code according to predefined rules, making it easier to read and maintain.

### ESLint
ESLint is a static code analysis tool that helps identify and fix problems in your JavaScript/TypeScript code. It enforces coding standards and best practices, ensuring your code is clean and error-free.

### Express
Express is a popular Node.js framework for building web applications and APIs. It simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware integration.

### Routes
Routes define the endpoints of your application. They map HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to specific functions that handle requests and send responses.

### Middleware
Middleware are functions that execute during the request-response cycle. They can modify request/response objects, perform authentication, log requests, or handle errors.

### Controller
Controllers are functions that handle the logic for specific routes. They process incoming requests, interact with services, and send responses back to the client.

### Services
Services contain the business logic of your application. They handle tasks like database operations, data validation, and external API calls.

### Utils
Utils (utilities) are helper functions or modules that provide reusable functionality across your application, such as formatting dates, generating IDs, or validating data.
